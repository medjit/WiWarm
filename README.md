# WiWarm

## Overview

WiWarm is an ESP8266-based smart WiFi fan controller designed to improve the efficiency of standard heating radiators. The hardware includes a buzzer, OLED display, buttons, DHT22 sensor for ambient temperature and humidity, and a DS18B20 sensor for radiator temperature. The system operates with a 12V DC power supply.

## Features

- **WiFi Connectivity**: Control the fan remotely via WiFi.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Uses DHT22 for ambient conditions.
- **Radiator Temperature Monitoring**: Uses DS18B20 for precise radiator temperature.
- **User Interface**: OLED display and buttons for local control.
- **Audible Alerts**: Buzzer for notifications and alerts.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller with WiFi capabilities.
- **DHT22**: Sensor for measuring ambient temperature and humidity.
- **DS18B20**: Sensor for measuring radiator temperature.
- **OLED Display**: For displaying system status and readings.
- **Buttons**: For user input and control.
- **Buzzer**: For audible alerts.
- **12V DC Power Supply**: Powers the entire system.

## Software

The software part of the project will be added later. It will include the firmware for the ESP8266 to handle sensor readings, control the fan, and communicate over WiFi.

## Installation

Instructions for installing and setting up the WiWarm system will be provided once the software is released.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be available after the software development is complete.
